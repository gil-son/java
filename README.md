# Java
## Practice

<p>
 Java is an object-oriented programming language that was first created in 1991 at Sun Microsystems. It started with the Green Project, in which the mentors were Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and James Gosling. This project was not intended to create a programming language, but rather to anticipate the “next wave” that would happen in the area of information technology and programming. The project's creators believed that in a short time, home appliances and computers would have a connection.
