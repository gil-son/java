## OO - Polymorphism

<p>Polymorphism:</p>
<p>Polymorphism is that in which we can perform a task in multiple forms or ways. It is applied to the functions or methods. Polymorphism allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time as well as run-time.</p>

<p>Types of Polymorphism are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)</li>
  <li>Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding)</li>
  
</ul>


<p> Hopefully that makes it clear as to what the differences are. Here is a comparison table.</p>

### Difference between Inheritance and Polymorphism

    <td>Inheritance supports the concept of reusability and reduces code length in object-oriented programming.</td>
    <td>Polymorphism allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time (overloading) as well as run-time (overriding).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Inheritance can be single, hybrid, multiple, hierarchical and multilevel inheritance.</td>
    <td>Whereas it can be compiled-time polymorphism (overload) as well as run-time polymorphism (overriding).</td>

    <td>It is used in pattern designing.</td>
    <td>While it is also used in pattern designing.</td>
