## OO - Polymorphism

<p>Polymorphism:</p>
<p>Polymorphism is that in which we can perform a task in multiple forms or ways. It is applied to the functions or methods. Polymorphism allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time as well as run-time.</p>

<p>Types of Polymorphism are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)</li>
  <li>Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding)</li>
  
</ul>


<p> Hopefully that makes it clear as to what the differences are. Here is a comparison table.</p>
