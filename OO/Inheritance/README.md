## OO - Inheritance


### Concept

<p>Inheritance:</p>
<p>Inheritance is one in which a new class is created that inherits the properties of the already exist class. It supports the concept of code reusability and reduces the length of the code in object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>Types of Inheritance are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single inheritance</li>
  <li>Multi-level inheritance</li>
  <li>Multiple inheritance</li>
  <li>Hybrid inheritance</li>
  <li>Hierarchical inheritance</li>
</ul>

### Difference between Inheritance and Polymorphism

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>INHERITANCE</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Inheritance is one in which a new class is created (derived class) that inherits the features from the already existing class(Base class).</td>
    <td>Whereas polymorphism is that which can be defined in multiple forms.</td>

    <td>It is basically applied to classes.</td>
    <td>Whereas it is basically applied to functions or methods.</td>

    <td>Inheritance supports the concept of reusability and reduces code length in object-oriented programming.</td>
    <td>Polymorphism allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time (overloading) as well as run-time (overriding).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Inheritance can be single, hybrid, multiple, hierarchical and multilevel inheritance.</td>
    <td>Whereas it can be compiled-time polymorphism (overload) as well as run-time polymorphism (overriding).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It is used in pattern designing.</td>
    <td>While it is also used in pattern designing.</td>
