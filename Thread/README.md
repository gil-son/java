## Thread


<p>
Threads has to do with parallel execution. This is very important today. Because? In fact, using our computer, we spend all our time doing several things at the same time.
</p>

<p>
At the moment when you use your computer, using a browser, running any software and so many other things being processed at the same time,
It is using multiple processes, in other words, multiple threads. So to say that a thread is a process is valid.
</p>
<p>
If there were no Threads, it would not be possible to do several things at the same time on your computer. The same applies when multiple people access a server
From students for example. If there were no Threads, the first student that accesses the login page would be able to, but the next student would need to wait for the first student to do what they need and leave, so that the second student can access the login page.
