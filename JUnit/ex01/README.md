## JUnit vs. TDD

<p>
This is JUnit, but not TDD, because the method was created with the business rule in the entity and then the test method with the @Test annotation with the logic of the expected value with the value to be compared.

In TDD, the test method is created with the @Test annotation, put the expected value to compare and it triggers the functionality. Only then will the tester create the rule for
business in such a way that it returns the expected value.</p>
